# README

_Stone_ is a lightweight, fast and modular PHP library. It's great for making web-based applications, and includes extra features for making test tools such as Hornet and StoryTeller.

## Installation

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:datasift/ms-lib-stone.git
cd ms-lib-stone
bash ./dev-setup.sh
```

This will install _Stone_ into _/usr/share/php/DataSift/Stone_ as a symlink.

## Target Version of PHP

_Stone_ should be compatible with PHP 5.3.latest onwards.  If you use any PHP 5.4 features, please keep them isolated inside specific _Stone_ modules.

## Running The Unit Tests

Regretably, _Stone_ currently lacks unit tests; something that we will be fixing shortly.
