# README

_Stone_ is a lightweight, fast and modular PHP library. It's great for making web-based applications, and includes extra features for making test tools such as Hornet and StoryTeller.

## Installation

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:datasift/ms-lib-stone.git
cd ms-lib-stone
bash ./dev-setup.sh
```

This will install _Stone_ into _/usr/share/php/DataSift/Stone_ as a symlink.
